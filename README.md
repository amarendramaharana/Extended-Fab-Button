Project Title
ðŸš€ Enhancing UX with Extended FAB in Android! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“±
Implemented an Extended Floating Action Button (FAB) that automatically shrinks and extends based on scroll behavior. When the user scrolls down, the FAB shrinks to a minimal state, keeping the UI clean and focused. When scrolling up, it expands again, ensuring easy access to key actions.
